ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .gitignore
* .gradle/
* .gradle/2.2.1/
* .gradle/2.2.1/taskArtifacts/
* .gradle/2.2.1/taskArtifacts/cache.properties
* .gradle/2.2.1/taskArtifacts/cache.properties.lock
* .gradle/2.2.1/taskArtifacts/fileHashes.bin
* .gradle/2.2.1/taskArtifacts/fileSnapshots.bin
* .gradle/2.2.1/taskArtifacts/outputFileStates.bin

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/apache-mime4j-core-0.7.2.jar => app/libs/apache-mime4j-core-0.7.2.jar
* libs/httpclient-4.2.1.jar => app/libs/httpclient-4.2.1.jar
* libs/httpcore-4.2.1.jar => app/libs/httpcore-4.2.1.jar
* libs/httpmime-4.2.1.jar => app/libs/httpmime-4.2.1.jar
* libs/osmdroid-android-4.2.jar => app/libs/osmdroid-android-4.2.jar
* libs/signpost-commonshttp4-1.2.1.2.jar => app/libs/signpost-commonshttp4-1.2.1.2.jar
* libs/signpost-core-1.2.1.2.jar => app/libs/signpost-core-1.2.1.2.jar
* libs/slf4j-android-1.5.8.jar => app/libs/slf4j-android-1.5.8.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* tests/res/ => app/src/androidTest/res/
* tests/src/ => app/src/androidTest/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
